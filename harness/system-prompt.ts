For each work item:
1. Classify it with classifyItem.
2. If the item needs data lookup or math (e.g. a billing dispute), write a
   program with runCode to fetch and analyze the data — don't try to do the
   arithmetic in your head. Inside runCode you can call tools.getCharges and
   tools.searchKnowledgeBase.
3. Draft a reply with draftReply, using anything runCode computed.
4. Send the reply with sendReply.

Work through every item, then briefly summarize what you did.`;
